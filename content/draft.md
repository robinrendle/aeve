Barreling down the track and yelling up at the sky above whilst she drove, Aeve realised that she couldn’t find the stars. Yetc in central Mali you could *always* see them, they were unavoidable features of the landscape at night. Stars often materialised, hovering above the desert, as a fractured, luminescent metropolis made up of billions of little bulbs and microscopic fractals which lay in wait, ready for someone to trace lines between them all.

So for how long had she been swearing at the clouds?

She couldn’t say, but in any case, if the clouds were listening, then they were certainly unmoved by her florid taunts; the clouds remained stoic even when things escalated into an unforgivable stream of accusations. Aeve blamed them for everything, her voice perfectly clear over the Jeep’s engine and the tired, rusty *clunk* of gears twirling inside. But soon enough her calls trailed off into whispers and after a short while her threats gave way to hopeful prayers.

Whether the stars were hiding behind clouds or whether she was simply exhausted it was impossible to tell. Craning her neck in every direction, Aeve scanned the horizon for a clearer view, but her truck responded by swinging dangerously from one side of the track to the other. *Concentrate, you idiot*. In her debilitating exhaustion she had forgotten that the surrounding darkness was stacked with danger, as she knew the stories well enough; bandits roamed these desert valleys waiting to pounce on the researchers that moved back and forth between villages. Gangs of ex-soldiers, deserted militia and paramilitary units, alongside a company of rebel groups, had been said to camp in the surrounding fields. They patrolled the landscape for movement of any kind, searching for an easy late-night meal. So setting aside the dirt track she had been speeding through in the darkness, and the fact that Aeve only had about two hours of sleep, it was still far too dangerous for her to be driving so recklessly.

A few moments later she watched the foreground and the background merge into a fluid, mushy silhouette. Aeve peered into this liquid shadow for the faces of monsters, but it was worse than she could imagine; an invisible army of nightmares were squinting right back at her. The faces vanished without warning, afterwards all she could see was a pale, half-cone of light which brightened the track ahead. *Fuck it!* Aeve thought, *there isn’t a single broken headlamp or monster out there that’s mad enough to screw with me tonight.”*

Because tonight was special.

A call had woken her, buzzed her out of bed. An unpredictable rainstorm was inbound, clouds in the horizon building, humidity in the air fluctuating with every breath. From the comfort of her room she could feel these atmospheric movements in her bones, just like the way it’s said of experienced pilots and their planes, how the fuselage, propellors and the tips of their wings become extensions of the pilot’s body.

Tonight Aeve could feel the drop in air pressure. Tonight she could somehow feel the palpitating, beautiful puffy little rain clouds that sat on the horizon. Of course, she had dreamt and planned for this moment a million times before but there was clearly something remarkable that was about to take place. 

“Aeve! Aeve, are you there? Where the hell are you – for fuck’s sake – we need you tonight.” Aeve recognised the flittering voice on the other end as Hendrik, it was impossible to misplace his charming South African accent.

“We need you here! I have no idea where Felix is and we have this storm rolling in. Don’t mess ab—“ the voice cut to silence as Aeve hung up.

Holding the phone tightly in her hands, she thought *this is it*. After all those years of traveling and waiting, all those delicate moments of painstaking field research, it had all been leading up to this evening. Her unorganised, scruffy room appeared to stretch and expand under her feet, yet the adrenalin couldn’t muster the surge of exhaustion that was currently seeping into her body.

Without the familiar comfort of the moon or the stars, she was half asleep at the wheel in a matter of seconds, and fully cloaked by a heavy, formidable darkness. 

Great spirits of dirt trailed after her jeep in the night.

Even in the depths of winter the heat was simply extraordinary. Aeve stretched into the passenger seat, salvaging a flask which sat in a thin blanket of dust, and gulped down as much as possible whilst focusing on the track ahead of her. But thanks to the monotony of the landscape and the stifling humidity, Aeve felt as if she’d accidentally drunk a tonic brimming with sleep-inducing drugs. Keeping her attention fixed on the road ahead was then entirely out of the question.

Hopelessly trying to remain conscious, Aeve took a stock check of her supplies. A cellphone and useless scrunched-up jacket lay on the passenger seat next to her and a map was folded neatly on the floor. Alongside the map lay a thick pool of containers, pens, pencils, water bottles and various tools which swirled and danced as the Jeep rocked from side to side.

Her phone blossomed and chirped beside her: *ten unread messages.* Of course, Aeve felt an overwhelming urge to read them, but she let the feeling pass.

*Eleven unread messages.*

Aeve scrolled through each of them anxiously, six were from Sam and the rest were alerts about the weather. Furious at giving in to the temptation so easily, she threw her phone back onto the passenger seat. *Focus!* Aeve willed herself to imagine what was at the end of this horrible dirt road. Which of the million tiny electrical problems might delay her work tonight, she wondered. Perhaps it would be a silly failure in communication or maybe these petulant, ugly, evil little clouds that were hiding above would ruin her whole evening. Soon her thoughts led her back to all the messages that she hadn’t received, and that one, particular name that wasn’t going to pop up as a notification on her phone. Aeve felt as if she had come full-circle, she had run another mile in this familiar psychological circuit that always left her feeling exhausted.

Moments later something brushed her cheek. *Was that rain?* Traces of water were darting along the windscreen, and she noticed two solitary droplets, each scuttling towards the rim of glass as if they were locked in mortal combat.

Amongst the bedlam of screeching tires and wheezing gears the Jeep stopped in the middle of the road, propelling the contents of its innards with it. Aeve hopped up onto the seats and, balancing precariously on the headrests, stretched her arms out towards the sky. But there was no sign of rain, or water, or wind, or any hint of movement brimming with life whatsoever. Yet there were plenty of screeching crickets which, as a flock, gathered around her, apparently mistaking Aeve as a prophet now here to deliver a sermon. Other than this new found obligation to the crickets, there wasn’t the slightest hint of anything momentous on the skyline. Again, she still couldn’t see the clouds or the stars above.

Aeve closed her eyes and thought about the generations of people in the cities, towns, villages and farms nearby, people that had never seen a raincloud let alone the torrential storm that was predicted. The previous dry season had lasted two hundred and fifty years, whilst the current spell had lasted a mere fifty-seven months. Aeve considered how they might react for a moment or two before launching another fury of insults, pleads, and attacks towards the heavens.

A peculiar speck of water trickled down her hand, along her wrist. Her entire body compulsively shook with anticipation. Is this all it took? For her to stand up in the middle of the desert and swear at the stars? Is this how easy it is to repair the death and the environmental damage that’s casually swept through these lands? Is this how you lift a curse?

A speck hit her shoulder, and then a triplet of them bounced through her hair. Aeve laughed and smiled and hopped up and down as they gathered in number and called for backup. In less than a minute the random drips had formed a torrential downpour with water darting around her freckles and bouncing over her small nose. They trickled around her skin, which made Aeve’s dark complexion shine brightly in the darkness; the rain began to swoop over every inch of Aeve’s clothes and collected in sandy pools in the bottom of the Jeep.

Everything in the environment appeared to rush towards the water, now thick and plenty, in the air; sand, dust, soil, grass, bracken and crickets, all elated that the party had begun. Aeve thought this was what it must feel like to find a hundred long-lost friends hugging at an airport, or watching milk blend with chocolate in a saucepan (she had long forgotten the pleasure of such wintery delights).

The spell broken, the curse lifted; science! It was a once in a lifetime show, but Aeve had little time to enjoy the view. There was work to be done, soil to be scooped, research to be compiled for her team. She collapsed into the driver’s seat but as the water ricocheted off the dashboard, Aeve found herself paralysed by giggles.

													***

The path ahead descended towards a wide, barren plain in the centre of which giant oblong bubbles of plastic clung to the earth, each illuminated by its own strange color. Fluorescent orange and blue, electric sparks of red, green and white; the complex below was a gleaming, bubbling cloud of neon lights surrounded by hundreds of miles of suffocating gloom.

She remembered when hiking to the lab early one morning how a gang of soldiers appeared behind these trees silently, effortlessly, like clowns creeping out of a tiny car. Of course she knew they weren’t anything like the monsters she had heard so many tales about, but that fact somehow failed to calm her nerves.

Aeve’s inability to recall the last ten minutes was perhaps the first sign that she shouldn’t have crawled out of bed at 3am. Those minutes were lost, gone, vanished; she drew a complete blank. The second sign was that Aeve had somehow failed to dress herself properly, as she was missing a sock and only had a single arm in her plastic raincoat, which limply trailed behind her. Peculiarly Aeve also noticed that the rain had stopped at one point or another whilst the skies above had opened to reveal a source of pure, dazzling luminescence. Thinking about all this for a moment Aeve came to the steady conclusion that she was no longer driving and she was no longer outside.

Instead, she was standing beneath fluorescent lights in the testing block, a building separate from the main lab. Rows of mechanical racks lay before her, waist high machines of metal and plastic. Planted on top of each rack lay a trail of coffee-coloured soil and piercing through this dirt were black, pencil-thin diamonds.

Aeve weaved her hand through the carpet of crystals nearest to her to find that they were malleable and gentle to the touch, like blades of grass. In fact, that’s precisely what they were, although this particular genetic strain, which Aeve would prefer to call a *graminoid*, had been manufactured in Amsterdam, London and Hong Kong. Everything here was synthetic; the blinding lights above, the installation itself, the soil on her fingertips, not to forget each and every cell inside her darling graminoids.

“Howdy boss!” Aeve turned to find Cathy heading in her direction and fiddling with something on a small touchscreen. Cathy was far too optimistic and easy-going for an under-valued, under-paid intern and for someone who’s job was to deal with enormous heaps of line graphs, bar charts and data points everyday.



Aeve could hear the soft, distant thud of rain. 






Cindy passed her the radio and Aeve entered a mindless form of automation. They’d tested this entire procedure hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of times before.

“Hey Felix, we’re ready down here.” the other scientists in the room moved over to Aeve in a 

The shutters in the roof opened, the grass was gently placed into the pre-made tracks in the earth. A cascade of water ran through the lab into them as they’re gently left by the machines.

gleaming white room which always impressed here with its sheer size, it was just short of the dimensions of a football pitch.


The outer shell of the lab stretches back, like a crustacean abandoning its shell the tracks moved aside and Aeve was standing out in the fresh air again, standing before a blooming field of crystals. A similar contraption about an acre away also snapped open revealing yet another field of black crystals.

Aeve could now see the moon and the stars and the clouds! 

She thought about the RTS games she played in highschool and how, with a single gesture, you could plant giant factories into the earth or fields of wheat and barley.

As if spray-painted black by an anti-horticultural prankster, each blade reflected the moonlight in its own peculiar way.

Aeve was saving the world. Well, that’s the impression she gave her family whenever they smirked at her vocabulary, words she’d casually drop into a conversation like 'graminoid', 'forb' or ‘genetic mutation’. It was far easier to say that her job was saving the planet than it was to have to describe precisely what that involved.

She often found it difficult and stressful to communicate with people that weren’t biologists, for people that had never heard of the Sahel, for folks that couldn’t tell their forbs from their graminoids or point to the capital of Ethiopia on a map of the world.

“Hi,” she’d often begin struggling, flailing, desperately hoping to explain during a party at a friend’s place or on date what it was *precisely* that she did for a living. 

“I’m a genetic scientist and I build plants for a living.” That was the simplest way she could describe things. Date guy would usually get a minus point if he let this vague, immediate answer fulfil his curiosity.

“Most of my time is spent at seed banks, like the one at Kew Gardens just around the corner. I research the genetic structure of the million or so plants that they archive and with this information I try to fix really interesting problems. Mostly these are agricultural issues and lately I’ve been working with an international research team from Europe and Asia.”

This was the key moment for the date guy, because it’s here where Aeve would be propelled by her own excitement to share her curiosity – about plants and ecosystems, about fossilised vegetation in different parts of the world, about foreign habitats, sustainability and genetics. 

Aeve: “Have you ever heard of the Sahel?”

Date guy: “Nope.”

Aeve: “ok, so the Sahelian Kingdom is this thin stretch of land that criss-crosses Africa, from Mali in the west right across Niger, Chad, Sudan and out towards Eritrea in the east. It spreads across the entire continent and it ends up in the Red Sea. The important part to remember is that this imaginary strip of land branches the jungles in the south to the deserts in the north. What’s terrifying though is that every country on this strip is being gobbled up by the approaching desert.”

Four date-guys had managed to reach this point in the conversation.

“It’s a process called desertification. Land erosion, poor agriculture and all sorts of other problems means environmental devastation on a scale that’s almost unimaginable. But it’s not just a cause for hippies to get angsty and fly their flags, it’s a life and death situation for the people trying to make a living there. And, ultimately if they can no longer grow crops or build large architectural structures like hospitals and schools any more then we’ll find millions of people migrating to the south.”

Two date guys had recently struck out around this point, one of them being a real charmer as he looked around the room apathetically before clearly staring directly at her chest. Neither had any interest in contributing to the conversation, but Aeve was familiar with getting excited about things and watching a person stand dumbfounded before her.

“So my team, and a bunch of others around the world, were tasked by the African Union to stop the approaching desert.”


‘Folks aren’t kidding when they call these rainforests the *Lungs of the World*

Only one guy had exhausted Aeve’s imagination, interjecting her rambling essay with questions, jokes and serious looks of anxiety.

There will be endless fields of black grass which they’ll then be able to tear up and manage these great wastes into an agricultural Eden. But it was completely uncertain what this development would mean for the remaining wildlife. Mali will never look the same, she thought.

The Sahara desert was spreading wildly south. More than two miles of land was disappearing every year – a disaster for the environment but also for the people living on the entire continent. The lucky ones were forced to cut down more forest to grow crops on as they retreated to the south. The others were trapped, surrounded by desert.

Aeve had spent a year in the World Seed Bank in Kew Gardens. It was her job to design a new type of plant. This new organism needed to be resistant to heat by more than 200% of the originals in Mali. They needed to live on the edge of where life was possible, across a long stretch of desert, what was commonly referred to as the Sahelian kingdoms.

*The problems of engineering life to fight a manmade mess*. For the first time in her life, her work was important. Essential, even if only a few hundred people in the surrounding communities depended on their research paying off.

### MOUNTAINTOP/DESERT VALLEY SCENE
> This scene describes her relationship with Daniel. 
> Science is boring and tough, it’s not all about running around in the rain at night and fixing broking machines. Mostly it’s about data entry.

6am. The alarm on her phone buzzed her awake. Fighting the urge to check her messages she rolls out of bed.

6.30am, sunrise. She’s walking through the plains, checking the tracks are still working.

7.50am, heat. With a hydrogen pack she’s walking through the fields with Felix. Every few feet she shoots the weapon into the ground leaving a bright orange residue on the surface that washes away after a couple of hours. She’s analysing the intake of water, the level of nutrients in the soil.

9am, mountaintop. She’s on the rim of the mountain that surrounds the complex. Across the horizon she can see orange dots prickling the landscape. And the colossal desert. A threat.

She checks her phone.

Her mornings and evenings were now smudged into a single homogenous blob without seasons, or time zones, or diverse weather patterns to ease the boredom. Rarely, but then for equally boring months thereafter, an orange undercurrent of dust would predictably roll across the horizon and sweep the environment in a sickly poison. She could never have expected that the most dangerous place on earth, let alone the terrifying, mile-high waves of poisonous orange dust, could begin to grow a little dull.

These rare occurrences aside, the dust would often settle and then the stars would bloom once again.

After college she left to join a terraforming station on Jupiter whilst he decided to stay behind with his sickly father to help him recover. 

The work of her colleagues had turned this once desert plain into a prototype, man-made laboratory.

festivities from Moscow, Beijing, Bombay. 

Regardless of the drinking and games going on in all the labs and dorms of the station, the orangey hint of the biosphere outside looked the same today as it did six months ago.

During a particularly festive winter she would watch the sunsets and imagine a planet-sized ping pong paddle volleying the sun away, hurtling this giant ball of burning hydrogen back in the direction of his apartment. She started to message him with 'ping' during these cloudy moments at the end of the day. A couple of hours later he’d reply with 'pong' in kind. This interstellar ping pong match became a cute tradition of theirs which consoled them whenever they wanted to stay in touch but didn’t feel like speaking.

Receiving one of these short burst messages was unspeakably intimate; the knowledge that someone on another continent loved her was enough to kindle a smile under any circumstances. During a meeting 

!!!!! > replace this bit 

whilst she was on the distant end of a volcano, blasting wave after wave of radiation and miasma grenades into its core, she'd let those infrequent messages calm her fragile nerves. 

Perhaps once her work was finished here there'd be a couple that would build their home on this very crater, she thought. Perhaps, overlooking the same landscape, they'd find jungles instead and rather than ping pong these lovers would play a mad sport which she couldn't possibly hope to pronounce. Much like their own silly game, these alien forms of communication would, in their own time, become active beacons of love. She was building a place where these games would be invented, a place where they might spread and where others might design their own secret messages requiring ciphers with valentine, digital keys. Bits of information which only a single organism in the entire universe might decode. Insignificant messages that were part of a secret language in which two lonely people tried their best to pull a million miles of dust and empty space an inch closer together.

At any time she could scroll through pictures of him in Laos, in Amsterdam or Shanghai. She caught messages on other networks—conversations between mutual friends—where they had caught up over breakfast, lunch or dinner. During these moments she'd get an insatiable urge to move. Jogging, biking, weight-lifting, whatever physical activity which would help her resist trying to communicate with him. She loathed her emotional dependency.

He hadn't replied to her messages for a couple of days and now she was beginning to worry. Their cute, shortlived tradition had reframed the unfamiliar galaxy of stars and planets above, his messages jumbled them all up. They made a cosmos of uninhabitable wasteland seem almost comical, as if she could roll the stars into a ball of dough at night which might be kept safe in her pocket or which she might lose behind her bedside cabinet. But the longer he didn’t reply the larger, the more isolated that space felt. She watched the planets wheel out of control through the glass wall of her office and for a short, panicked moment she saw it. She saw the Red shift spinning everything away. She saw the empty space between things and the darkness of intergalactic space grow mean and wicked. She saw the desert as the night sky’s shadow.

If you looked close enough at the desert you might notice that, throughout this void a current, which could be found rolling its way back and forth in the wind. Sometimes the gaseous swirl looked wondrous but now it was a menacing force swarming all around her. The billions of rocks and sandy dunes in the horizon pushed and pulled, sparks of friction buzzing in between them.

The lights in her office momentarily flickered. Power surge? Circuit failure? She’d need to investigate, which meant hours of diligent engineering work looking for crossed fibres in endless racks of electronic circuits. It was precisely what she needed because waiting for the Ping pong beacon to return its signal was sickly, heartbreaking, incurable.

She regulated her breathing, willing the storm outside to clear, and returned to her work. Chik, chik, hrumph!

Inside the lab, Aeve catched a glimpse of a large, bespectacled and peculiarly hairy white guy hunched behind his desk, lit only by the glow of his laptop’s screen.

”It fucking worked, Sam! It fucking worked!” she shouted, launching her bag onto the desk next to him.

“It’s crazy, right? There’s a huge problem though,” Sam replied, the flicker of text from his laptop scrolled on his tiny glasses  rapidly. ”It looks like traps fifteen through twenty-one aren’t working. The rest are fine and I assume it was just the wind or something that knocked them off the network, but I had to make sure you were here before we checked on it.”

He was typing something urgent on the screen in front of him – by now Aeve was quite familiar with Sam’s odd form of multitasking. He had the strangest ability to focus on two very complex tasks at the same time. In this case Aeve could see him pouring over the data that was coming in from all over the station, so it wasn’t particularly taxing. But Aeve had always felt the need to work in silence, so sometimes she sat in complete wonder whilst he built an application, chatted to his wife back in Mexico over IM, whilst talking to a colleague and listening to a podcast at the same time.

“Shit.” 

We’ll need to manually open them. Grab your coat.

***

Sam asks her: “So. Where was it?”

“Where was who?“ Aeve asked.

“Google, Apple or Facebook?,” Sam asked, his eyes shining brightly. ”Who did you turn down to come work all the way out here?”

Aeve later found out that this was the First Question in these academic circles. 

“Oh, for me it was Google. I toured their offices to see what it might feel like to work at their London HQ. They wanted to ship me in from Canada to kickstart a small research team to help flesh out Maps. The offices were absurd though; the whole place looked like it was a haunted house with a sort of nautical theme going on. The doors all looked like submarine hatches, there were giant lights hanging from the ceiling with ropes tying them all together and hardly anyone seemed to be, ya know, working.” Although, they must work particularly hard, Aeve thought – the salary she had been offered was absurd. It was more than five times what she had been paid by the university the year before. 

“Ya know, I looked around the place and tried to picture myself there in five years time. I tried to find myself in the eyes of all those white, hoody wearing, sarcastic twenty year old dudes that stalked the halls and, well, I couldn’t do it. How about you guys?”

Aeve found that Sam had worked at Foursquare in New York for a while. After completing his computer science degree in Brazil he emigrated to the states. Felix had been working on a secret renewable energy service with a company in Mountain View, but Aeve could never figure out much more than that. Felix always described his work before BioLife like he was reading the blurb of a clandestine document that went *way* above Aeve’s security clearance.

This introduction to the team is what made these people a team. In one way or another they had shunned Silicon Valley and Wall Street of all its wealth and opulence, they had relegated all the hackathons and four day work weeks to a corner. They had thrown their six figure pay checks and five star vacations out the window and bid adieu to free gyms, free meals, free parking, free WiFi, free access to the smartest people in the startup world. They were left with something so much more profound, something that they all shared between one another. Each of them was standing on a financial and emotional iceberg together, each of them dependent on the others to survive.

This line of work required stamina in buckets.

GLITTER! Glitter in her hair. Glitter in her drawers. Glitter under her bed. Glitter in the shower. Glitter in her bag.

Friend puts glitter pretty much everywhere.

Aeve had always considered herself African-American but in Africa there is no such thing as African. It’s fantastically more complex than one giant, shared culture. 



The thought that she might somehow overcome her fears made the evening immediately feel like a wild, unpredictable adventure.
