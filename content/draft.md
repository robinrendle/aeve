Barreling down the track and yelling up at the sky above whilst she drove, Aeve realised that she couldn’t find the stars. Yet in central Mali you could *always* see them, they were unavoidable features of the landscape at night. Stars often materialised, hovering above the desert, as a fractured, luminescent metropolis made up of billions of little bulbs and microscopic fractals that lay in wait, ready for someone to trace lines between them all.

So for how long had she been swearing at the clouds?

In any case, if the clouds were listening, they were certainly unmoved by her florid taunts; they remained stoic even when things escalated into an unforgivable stream of accusations. Aeve blamed the clouds for everything, her voice perfectly clear over the truck’s engine and the tired, rusty *clunk* of gears twirling inside. But soon enough her calls trailed off into whispers and after a short while her threats gave way to hopeful prayers.

She couldn’t decide whether the stars were out tonight or whether she was simply exhausted. Craning her neck in every direction, Aeve scanned the horizon for a clearer view, but her truck responded by swinging dangerously from one side of the track to the other. *Concentrate, you idiot*. In her debilitating exhaustion she had forgotten that the surrounding darkness was stacked with danger, as she knew the stories well enough; bandits roamed these desert valleys waiting to pounce on the researchers that moved back and forth between villages. Gangs of ex-soldiers, deserted militia and paramilitary units, alongside a company of rebel groups, had been said to camp out in the surrounding fields. They patrolled the landscape for movement of any kind, searching of an easy late-night meal. So setting aside the dirt track she had been speeding through in the darkness, and the fact that she only had about two hours sleep, it was still far too dangerous for Aeve to be driving so recklessly.

A few moments later she watched the foreground and the background merge into a fluid, mushy silhouette. Aeve peered into this liquid shadow for the faces of monsters, and she could begin to imagine an invisible army of nightmares camped out in the darkness. Once she had shaken the tiredness from her body the faces vanished, now all she could see was a pale, half-cone of light which brightened the track ahead. *Fuck it!* she thought, *there isn’t a single broken headlamp or monster out there that’s mad enough to screw with me tonight.”*

Because tonight was special.

A call had woken her, buzzed her out of bed. An unpredictable rainstorm was inbound, clouds in the horizon building, humidity in the air fluctuating with every breath. From the comfort of her room she could feel these atmospheric movements in her bones, just like the way it’s said of experienced pilots and their planes, how the fuselage, propellors and the tips of their wings become extensions of the pilot’s body.

Tonight she could feel the drop in air pressure. Tonight she could somehow feel the palpitating, beautiful puffy little rain clouds that sat on the horizon. Of course, she had dreamt and planned for this moment a million times before but tonight something was different. The evening air was a buzz of nerves, possibilities and unpredictable adventures.

“Aeve! Aeve, are you there? Where the hell are you – for fuck’s sake – we need you tonight.” Aeve recognised the flittering voice on the other end as Sam, a colleague that often took his job a little too seriously.

“What’s wrong?” Aeve yawned into her cellphone, trying to hide her excitement as much as possible.

“We need you here! I have no idea where Felix is and we have this storm rolling in. Don’t mess ab—“ the voice cut to silence as Aeve hung up.

Holding the phone tightly in her hands, she thought *this is it*. After all these years of traveling and waiting, all these delicate moments of painstaking field research, it had all been leading up to this evening. Her unorganised, scruffy room appeared to stretch and expand under her feet, yet the adrenalin couldn’t muster the surge of exhaustion that was currently seeping into her body.

Without the familiar comfort of the stars, she was half asleep at the wheel in a matter of seconds, and fully cloaked by a heavy, formidable darkness. Great spirits of dirt trailed after her jeep in the night.

***

In the depths of winter the heat was simply extraordinary. Aeve stretched into the passenger seat and, salvaging a flask coated in sand and dust, gulped down as much as possible whilst focusing on the track ahead. But keeping her attention on the road was almost impossible – the darkened landscape combined with the warm, foul air, mixed themselves together into a tonic of delirious monotony.

The innards of the jeep pulled into focus as she tried desperately to stay awake; her cellphone and useless, scrunched-up jacket lay on the passenger seat next to her and a map was folded neatly on the floor along with a thick pool of pens, pencils and measuring equipment which swirled and danced around as the jeep rocked from side to side. She suddenly had an overwhelming urge to check her phone for new messages or updates on the storm, and tried to let the feeling pass.

Ten unread messages. 

She scrolled through each of them anxiously; six of them were from Sam and the others were notifications about the weather. Aeve threw her phone back onto the passenger seat, angry at giving in to the temptation so easily. *Concentrate, concentrate!* She willed herself to think about what was at the end of the road, about what would happen once she got into her lab again, but she started thinking about all the messages that she didn’t recieve, all the names that weren’t popping up as notifications.

Aeve noticed traces of water on the windscreen; two distinct droplets to be precise, competitively scuttling towards the rim, clearly in some sort of competition against one another. Moments later she felt something brush her cheek. *Was that rain?* She brushed her face and turned to the sky just above the horizon. Aeve hit the brakes and the engine gasped and wheezed into a quiet, bubbling rumble whilst the truck lurched forward, propelling the contents of its innards with it. 

She hopped up onto the seats and, trying to balance properly without toppling over, she stretched her arms out wide from the roofless jeep.

There was no sign of rain, or water, or wind, or any hint of movement brimming with life whatsoever. Yet, there were plenty of screeching crickets. As a flock they gathered, apparently they mistook Aeve as a prophet bearing a wonderful sermon. 

Other than her new found holiness, there wasn’t the slightest hint of rain. Aeve thought about the generations of Mali people in the cities, towns, villages and farms, people that have never seen a raincloud, let alone the torrential storm that was predicted for tonight. The previous dry season had lasted two hundred and fifty years, whilst the current spell had lasted a mere fifty-seven months. *’How would they react*?’, she wondered.

Another fury of insults, pleads, and attacks was launched at the heavens before Aeve felt a peculiar speck of water on her wrist. Her entire body compulsively shook with anticipation. Is this all it took? For her to stand up in the middle of the desert and swear at the stars? Another speck hit her shoulder, and then a triplet of drips bounced through her hair. Aeve laughed and smiled and hopped as they gathered in number and called for backup. In less than a minute the random drips had formed a torrential downpour with water darting around her freckles and bouncing over her small nose, it hopped over her skin, which made her dark-brown complexion shine brightly in the darkness; the rain began to swoop over every inch of Aeve’s clothes and trickled into sandy pools in the bottom of the jeep.

The curse lifted, the spell broken; science! It was a once in a lifetime show, but Aeve had little time to enjoy the view. There was work to be done, soil to be scooped, research to be compiled for her team. She collapsed into the driver’s seat giggling and watched the water ricochet off the dashboard; the red sand and dust bound with the water, now thick and plenty, which appeared to levitate in the air around her. This liquid-dust substance took form like milk blending with hot chocolate in a saucepan. 

***

A familiar clearing appeared where the path descended further towards a wide, barren plain. In the centre, giant oblong bubbles of plastic clung to the earth, each illuminated in bright neon colours. Bright orange and blue, electric sparks of red and green; the complex below was a gleaming, bubbling cloud of lights surrounded by hundreds of miles of suffocating gloom.

Aeve frantically checked into the facility with her eight digit password via radio before shaking the sleepiness from her body again and racing down the hill. 

She thought about the time when she hiked to the lab early one morning; a gang of soldiers appeared behind these trees silently, effortlessly, like clowns creeping out of a tiny car. Of course she knew they weren’t anything like the monsters she had heard so many tales about, but that fact somehow failed to calm her nerves.

> The whole point of this scene is to describe what Aeve does and what the problem is – it needs to tell us that she’s in Mali and why/how she got there. That she’s a bioengineer working on protecting the Sahel from increasing amounts of desertation along the central axis of the country. She travels a lot. Last year she was in Cameroon working with another team, six months previous she was in another country.
> What does she need to do in the facility?
> Sam and Aeve are friends.


Stark lights. Unrealistic shadows. 

Sharp, black crystals, organic lifeforms that blew in the wind as Aeve opened the door to the lab.

Aeve waved her hand across these crystals and they were soft to the touch.

The grass (NAME?) had been cross-bred, designed and built in Amsterdam. The Sahara desert was spreading wildly south. More than two miles of land was disappearing every year – a disaster for the environment but also for the people living on this island. The lucky ones were forced to cut down more forest to grow crops on as they retreated to the south. The others were trapped, surrounded by desert.

Aeve had spent a year in the World Seed Bank in Kew Gardens. It was her job to design a new type of plant. This new organism needed to be resistant to heat by more than 200% of the originals in Mali. They needed to live on the edge of where life was possible, across a long stretch of desert, what was commonly referred to as the Sahelian kingdoms.

*The problems of engineering life to fight a manmade mess*. For the first time in her life, her work was important. Essential, even if only a few hundred people in the surrounding communities depended on their research paying off. 

There will be endless fields of black grass which they’ll then be able to tear up and manage these great wastes into an agricultural Eden. But it was completely uncertain what this development would mean for the remaining wildlife. Mali will never look the same, she thought.


***

The shutters in the roof opened, the grass was gently placed into the pre-made tracks in the earth. A cascade of water through the lab into them as they’re gently left by the machines.

The outer shell of the lab stretches back, like a crustacean abandoning its shell the tracks moved aside and Aeve was standing out in the fresh air again, standing before a blooming field. A similar contraption about an acre away also snapped open revealing yet another field of black crystals.

She was wearing a cheap plastic rain coat.

She thought about the RTS games she played in highschool and how, with a click of the mouse, you could plant giant factories into the earth or fields of wheat and barley.

This is the moment they had all been waiting for. 

Whenever someone asked her what her job was she went into a long missive about saving the Sahelian kingdoms from extinction. She found it difficult to get on with people that weren’t biologists.



Aeve moved over to a minifridge in the corner of the room and started to drink the most caffeineted thing that she could find.

WEAPONIZED RAINCLOUDS? Has a friend that builds the bomb, Clementine, which causes rainclouds. 

> Some kind of argument ensues about what to do next.
> She falls asleep in the lab in one of the private rooms.

BioLife – a horribly named organisation.

### MOUNTAINTOP/DESERT VALLEY SCENE
> This scene describes her relationship with Daniel. 
> Science is boring and tough, it’s not all about running around in the rain at night and fixing broking machines. Mostly it’s about data entry.

6am. The alarm on her phone buzzed her awake. Fighting the urge to check her messages she rolls out of bed.

6.30am, sunrise. She’s walking through the plains, checking the tracks are still working.

7.50am, heat. With a hydrogen pack she’s walking through the fields with Felix. Every few feet she shoots the weapon into the ground leaving a bright orange residue on the surface that washes away after a couple of hours. She’s analysing the intake of water, the level of nutrients in the soil.

9am, mountaintop. She’s on the rim of the mountain that surrounds the complex. Across the horizon she can see orange dots prickling the landscape. And the colossal desert. A threat.

She checks her phone. 


***

Her mornings and evenings were now smudged into a single homogenous blob without seasons, or time zones, or diverse weather patterns to ease the boredom. Rarely, but then for equally boring months thereafter, an orange undercurrent of dust would predictably roll across the horizon and sweep the environment in a sickly poison. She could never have expected that the most dangerous place on earth, let alone the terrifying, mile-high waves of poisonous orange dust, could begin to grow a little dull.

These rare occurrences aside, the dust would often settle and then the stars would bloom once again.

After college she left to join a terraforming station on Jupiter whilst he decided to stay behind with his sickly father to help him recover. 

The work of her colleagues had turned this once desert plain into a prototype, man-made laboratory.

festivities from Moscow, Beijing, Bombay. 

Regardless of the drinking and games going on in all the labs and dorms of the station, the orangey hint of the biosphere outside looked the same today as it did six months ago.

During a particularly festive winter she would watch the sunsets and imagine a planet-sized ping pong paddle volleying the sun away, hurtling this giant ball of burning hydrogen back in the direction of his apartment. She started to message him with 'ping' during these cloudy moments at the end of the day. A couple of hours later he’d reply with 'pong' in kind. This interstellar ping pong match became a cute tradition of theirs which consoled them whenever they wanted to stay in touch but didn’t feel like speaking.

Receiving one of these short burst messages was unspeakably intimate; the knowledge that someone on another continent loved her was enough to kindle a smile under any circumstances. During a meeting 

!!!!! > replace this bit 

whilst she was on the distant end of a volcano, blasting wave after wave of radiation and miasma grenades into its core, she'd let those infrequent messages calm her fragile nerves. 

Perhaps once her work was finished here there'd be a couple that would build their home on this very crater, she thought. Perhaps, overlooking the same landscape, they'd find jungles instead and rather than ping pong these lovers would play a mad sport which she couldn't possibly hope to pronounce. Much like their own silly game, these alien forms of communication would, in their own time, become active beacons of love. She was building a place where these games would be invented, a place where they might spread and where others might design their own secret messages requiring ciphers with valentine, digital keys. Bits of information which only a single organism in the entire universe might decode. Insignificant messages that were part of a secret language in which two lonely people tried their best to pull a million miles of dust and empty space an inch closer together.

At any time she could scroll through pictures of him in Laos, in Amsterdam or Shanghai. She caught messages on other networks—conversations between mutual friends—where they had caught up over breakfast, lunch or dinner. During these moments she'd get an insatiable urge to move. Jogging, biking, weight-lifting, whatever physical activity which would help her resist trying to communicate with him. She loathed her emotional dependency.

He hadn't replied to her messages for a couple of days and now she was beginning to worry. Their cute, shortlived tradition had reframed the unfamiliar galaxy of stars and planets above, his messages jumbled them all up. They made a cosmos of uninhabitable wasteland seem almost comical, as if she could roll the stars into a ball of dough at night which might be kept safe in her pocket or which she might lose behind her bedside cabinet. But the longer he didn’t reply the larger, the more isolated that space felt. She watched the planets wheel out of control through the glass wall of her office and for a short, panicked moment she saw it. She saw the Red shift spinning everything away. She saw the empty space between things and the darkness of intergalactic space grow mean and wicked. She saw the desert as the night sky’s shadow.

If you looked close enough at the desert you might notice that, throughout this void a current, which could be found rolling its way back and forth in the wind. Sometimes the gaseous swirl looked wondrous but now it was a menacing force swarming all around her. The billions of rocks and sandy dunes in the horizon pushed and pulled, sparks of friction buzzing in between them.

The lights in her office momentarily flickered. Power surge? Circuit failure? She’d need to investigate, which meant hours of diligent engineering work looking for crossed fibres in endless racks of electronic circuits. It was precisely what she needed because waiting for the Ping pong beacon to return its signal was sickly, heartbreaking, incurable.

She regulated her breathing, willing the storm outside to clear, and returned to her work. Chik, chik, hrumph!

Inside the lab, Aeve catched a glimpse of a large, bespectacled and peculiarly hairy white guy hunched behind his desk, lit only by the glow of his laptop’s screen.

”It fucking worked, Sam! It fucking worked!” she shouted, launching her bag onto the desk next to him.

“It’s crazy, right? There’s a huge problem though,” Sam replied, the flicker of text from his laptop scrolled on his tiny glasses  rapidly. ”It looks like traps fifteen through twenty-one aren’t working. The rest are fine and I assume it was just the wind or something that knocked them off the network, but I had to make sure you were here before we checked on it.”

He was typing something urgent on the screen in front of him – by now Aeve was quite familiar with Sam’s odd form of multitasking. He had the strangest ability to focus on two very complex tasks at the same time. In this case Aeve could see him pouring over the data that was coming in from all over the station, so it wasn’t particularly taxing. But Aeve had always felt the need to work in silence, so sometimes she sat in complete wonder whilst he built an application, chatted to his wife back in Mexico over IM, whilst talking to a colleague and listening to a podcast at the same time.

“Shit.” 

We’ll need to manually open them. Grab your coat.

***

Sam asks her: “So. Where was it?”

“Where was who?“ Aeve asked.

“Google, Apple or Facebook?,” Sam asked, his eyes shining brightly. ”Who did you turn down to come work all the way out here?”

Aeve later found out that this was the First Question in these academic circles. 

“Oh, for me it was Google. I toured their offices to see what it might feel like to work at their London HQ. They wanted to ship me in from Canada to kickstart a small research team to help flesh out Maps. The offices were absurd though; the whole place looked like it was a haunted house with a sort of nautical theme going on. The doors all looked like submarine hatches, there were giant lights hanging from the ceiling with ropes tying them all together and hardly anyone seemed to be, ya know, working.” Although, they must work particularly hard, Aeve thought – the salary she had been offered was absurd. It was more than five times what she had been paid by the university the year before. 

“Ya know, I looked around the place and tried to picture myself there in five years time. I tried to find myself in the eyes of all those white, hoody wearing, sarcastic twenty year old dudes that stalked the halls and, well, I couldn’t do it. How about you guys?”

Aeve found that Sam had worked at Foursquare in New York for a while. After completing his computer science degree in Brazil he emigrated to the states. Felix had been working on a secret renewable energy service with a company in Mountain View, but Aeve could never figure out much more than that. Felix always described his work before BioLife like he was reading the blurb of a clandestine document that went *way* above Aeve’s security clearance.

This introduction to the team is what made these people a team. In one way or another they had shunned Silicon Valley and Wall Street of all its wealth and opulence, they had relegated all the hackathons and four day work weeks to a corner. They had thrown their six figure pay checks and five star vacations out the window and bid adieu to free gyms, free meals, free parking, free WiFi, free access to the smartest people in the startup world. They were left with something so much more profound, something that they all shared between one another. Each of them was standing on a financial and emotional iceberg together, each of them dependent on the others to survive.
