# The Beacon
## A story of heartbreak and science

## 1

Barreling down the track and yelling up at the sky above whilst she drove, Aeve realised that she couldn’t find the stars. Yet in central Mali you could always see them, they were unavoidable features of the landscape at night. Stars often materialised, hovering above the desert as a fractured, luminescent metropolis made up of billions of little bulbs and microscopic fractals which lay in wait, ready for someone to trace lines between them all.

For how long had Aeve been swearing at the clouds? She couldn’t say. In any case, if the clouds were listening, then they were certainly unmoved by her florid taunts. They remained stoic even when things escalated into an unforgivable stream of accusations as Aeve blamed the clouds for everything. Her voice could be heard clearly over the Jeep’s engine and the tired, rusty *clunk* of gears twirling inside yet soon enough her calls trailed off into whispers and after a short while her threats gave way to hopeful prayers.

Craning her neck in every direction Aeve scanned the distance; whether the stars were hiding behind clouds or whether she was simply exhausted it was still difficult to tell. Were the clouds really up there? Her Jeep responded to these movements by dangerously swinging from one side of the track to the other and as she regained control of the vehicle Aeve remembered that the surrounding darkness was stacked with danger, she knew the stories well enough. Bandits roamed these desert highways waiting to pounce on the researchers that moved back and forth between villages. Gangs of ex-soldiers, deserted militia and paramilitary units, alongside a company of rebel groups, had been said to camp in the surrounding fields. They patrolled the landscape for movement of any kind, searching for an easy late-night meal. So setting aside the dirt track she had been speeding through in the darkness, and the fact that Aeve only had about two hours of sleep, it was still far too dangerous for her to be driving so recklessly.

A few moments later she watched the foreground and the background merge into a fluid, mushy silhouette. Aeve peered into this liquid shadow for monsters but it was worse than she could imagine – an invisible army of nightmares were squinting right back. Silently, effortlessly, like clowns creeping out of a toy car, they appeared before her and as they took shape Aeve remembered how a platoon of camouflaged men had sprung out from the other side of a hedgerow whilst her team was hiking around the lab early one morning. These ghostly pale French soldiers weren’t anything like the others she’d heard so many tales about, however that failed to calm her nerves somehow. For Aeve, *men with guns* would now, forever and always remain to be simply *men with guns*.

Suddenly the faces vanished without warning and all she could see was a pale, half-cone of light from the Jeep which brightened the track ahead. “*Fuck it!*” Aeve thought, *“there isn’t a single broken headlamp or monster out there that’s mad enough to screw with me tonight.”*

Because tonight was special. 

A call had woken her, buzzed her out of bed. An unpredictable rainstorm was inbound, clouds in the horizon building, humidity in the air fluctuating with every breath. From the comfort of her room she could feel these atmospheric movements in her bones, just like it’s said of experienced pilots and their planes — how the fuselage, propellors and the tips of their wings become extensions of the pilot’s body.

For months Aeve had been hatching plans, she’d dreamt about the uninhabited space up in the Malian troposphere; from cirrus and altostratus clouds to their distant cumulonimbus friends, they were all unwelcome guests in the skies above Mali. But that night she could feel the drop in air pressure and she could even sense the palpitating, beautiful puffy little rain clouds that slept outside.

“Aeve, are you there? Where the hell are you? I’ve been looking all over for you!” Aeve recognised the flittering voice on the other end of the phone as Hendrik, it was impossible to misplace his South African accent. “I’ve no idea where Felix is and we have this storm rolling in. Don’t—” Hendrik’s voice cut to silence as Aeve hung up. Holding the phone tightly in her hands, she thought *this is it*. After all these years of traveling and waiting, all those delicate moments of painstaking field research, it had all been leading up to this evening. Her room appeared to stretch and expand under her feet.

Without the familiar comfort of the moon or the stars, Aeve was half asleep at the wheel in a matter of seconds and fully cloaked by a heavy, formidable darkness; great spirits of dirt trailed after her jeep in the night.

Even in the depths of winter the heat was simply extraordinary. Aeve stretched into the passenger seat, salvaging a flask which lay in a thin blanket of dust, and gulped down as much as possible. Thanks to the repetitive landscape and the stifling humidity, Aeve wondered if she’d accidentally picked up a tonic brimming with drugs and sleep-inducing chemicals instead. Keeping her attention fixed on the empty road was then entirely out of the question.

Hopelessly trying to remain conscious Aeve took a stock check of her supplies; a cellphone and a useless, scrunched-up jacket sat on the passenger seat next to her and a map was folded neatly on the floor. Alongside the map lay a thick pool of containers, pens, rulers, water bottles and various tools which swirled as the Jeep rocked from one side to the other. Her phone was lightly chirping in amongst the chaos and had bloomed into a rectangle of light: *ten unread messages*. Consequently her urge to read them all was overwhelming but she let the feeling pass as best she could, this small dose of confidence and self control was enough to keep her hands steady at the wheel.

*Eleven unread messages.*

Shaking her head, Aeve anxiously scrolled through them and found that five were from Hendrik whilst the rest had been alerts about the storm. She furiously threw her phone back onto the passenger seat with a *thump*. Compared to the miles of empty road ahead, all the technical failures which had delayed their work in the past had now started to look friendly and pleasant. Tonight it might be a blip in communication she wondered, or possibly the clouds that were hiding above would somehow ruin everything again. Nonetheless it was here that Aeve discovered she had run another mile in a psychological marathon that always left her feeling exhausted. First it began with anxiety and daydreams of professional disaster, next her thoughts would trot through all the notifications on her phone and remember that one, particular name that hadn’t popped up. 

Traces of water were darting along the windscreen and she noticed two solitary droplets, each scuttling towards the outer rim of glass as if they were locked in mortal combat. Amongst the bedlam of screeching tires and wheezing gears the Jeep swerved to a halt in the middle of the road, but there was no sign of rain, or water, or wind, or any hint of movement or life whatsoever. Aeve jumped up onto the seats to get a better view. 

The only star-like entities in the sky were a series of red bulbs which were mounted one on top of the other out on the furthest edge of the landscape. Like a cell tower in a large city, it seemed insignificant from a distance yet somehow Aeve found it impossible to grow accustom to. She knew it to be the first of its kind; the beacon was a paranormal megastructure that could terraform the earth. Aeve watched as the lights gently sparkled in unison, remembering that this was only a single tower in an expansive network of relays which spanned across the continent. 

Particles of silver iodide were injected into the troposphere by the use of artillery batteries, courtesy of the French military. This would stimulate the growth of cloud cover so that the beacons on the highest peaks of Mali could send sharp electrical charges into the surrounding atmosphere and through this process they could generate clouds at will. It was highly experimental but at this point the Malian government was desperate to test the most outrageous suggestions, even with what this team called ‘cloud seeding’. Her meeting with the skeleton crew that manned the station out there on the peak of Mount Hombori had unexpectedly intimidated her; the technology that powered the beacon seemed unlearnable, omnipotent. Aeve stood dumbfounded in their dim little office whilst they described how readily they could draw the clouds together and generate weather patterns that were predictable, uniform, routine. Throughout the meeting Aeve couldn’t stop thinking about the people in Timbuktu and Bamako and those in the nearby towns and farms, whole generations that had never seen the rain and those that stood by as engineers had built this imposing network of towers across their country. Two hundred and fifty years of parched, cloudless skies had cursed these lands and so Aeve speculated as to how they might react to the first synthetic rainclouds.

Launching another fury of insults, pleads, and attacks towards the unlit heavens, Aeve compulsively shook with anticipation. As she did, a speck of water trickled along her shoulder and down the length of her arm. *Is this all it took?* she wondered. Is this how easy it was to repair the death and the environmental damage that casually swept through these lands? Forget the beacon and all its magic; did she simply have to stand up in the middle of the desert and swear at the invisible, bloated bellies of the clouds for them to abandon their game?

Yet another drop, and then another; a gang of them bounced through her hair. Aeve chuckled and leapt up and down as they gathered in number and called for backup. In less than a minute the random drips had formed a torrential downpour, with water spinning around her freckles, bouncing off her nose and collecting at the bottom of the Jeep into a broad, sandy puddle. From a distance Aeve’s dark complexion sparkled against the rain and the incoming mist.

Everything in the environment appeared to rush towards the water, now thick and plentiful, in the air; sand, dust, soil, grass, bracken and crickets, all elated that the party could begin. Aeve thought this was like watching a hundred long-lost friends hugging at an airport, or perhaps waiting for milk to blend with chocolate in a saucepan (she had long forgotten the pleasure of such wintery delights).

The spell broken, the curse lifted; science! It was a once in a lifetime show but Aeve had little time to enjoy the view. There was work to be done, soil to be scooped, research to be compiled for her team. She collapsed into the driver’s seat as the rain ricocheted off the dashboard yet she couldn’t move; Aeve found herself curiously immobilised by a long parade of giggles.

Her inability to recall the last ten minutes was perhaps the first sign that Aeve shouldn’t have given up on sleep. Those minutes were lost, gone, vanished; she drew a complete blank. The second sign was that Aeve had somehow failed to dress herself properly, as she was missing a sock and only had a single arm in her plastic raincoat which limply trailed behind her. Oddly enough, Aeve also noticed that the rain had vanished whilst the skies above had opened to reveal a source of pure, dazzling luminescence at one point or another. Thinking about all this for a moment Aeve came to the steady conclusion that she was no longer driving and she was no longer outside.

As a matter of fact Aeve was stood beneath the fluorescent lights of test block 7-A, a single open-plan building about the size of a football pitch, separate from the main lab. Rows of mechanical racks lay before her, waist high machines of metal and plastic. Planted on top of each rack lay a trail of coffee-coloured soil and through this dirt could be seen black, pencil-thin diamonds piercing the surface. 

She laced her hand through the batch nearest to her only to discover that this rich carpet of crystal was malleable and gentle to the touch like blades of grass in a field. Indeed, they were related, although this particular genetic strain, which Aeve would prefer to call a *graminoid*, had been manufactured in Amsterdam, South Africa, London and Hong Kong. Everything here was synthetic and alien to Mali; the blinding lights above, the soil on her fingertips, not to mention each and every cell inside Aeve’s darling graminoids.

“Howdy, boss!” 

Aeve turned to find Cathy Sŏng, a Texan-South-Korean-American intern from MIT, heading in her direction and fiddling with something on a small touchscreen. Cathy was far too optimistic and easy-going for someone so under-valued, under-paid and over-worked — at every opportunity she smiled her way through the gathering of bar charts and tedious spark lines as well as throughout the long hours of mindless data-entry tasks. It was the kind of work which by now, Aeve imagined, should have broken her spirit at least in some recognisable manner.

“Hi Cathy, how’s it going?” Aeve sorely replied.

“Oh, just great! Although Hendrik was looking for you earlier, he seemed a little anxious that you weren’t here tonight but I guess that doesn’t matter now though.” At this Cathy seemed to make a little hop in the air. “Isn’t it so exciting!”

“Yeah, I sort of can’t believe it either,” Aeve groaned as she took off her raincoat and passed a hand through her soaking hair. ”Is everything ready? Have you checked the racks?”

“Yep! And I got a hold of Felix earlier so he helped me check, double check and triple check they’re all working properly.” Strangely enough there wasn’t the slightest hint of fatigue or frustration in Cathy’s voice so Aeve asked for a walkie-talkie and an emergency coffee ASAP whilst she walked through the lab, double-checking Cathy’s triple-checking that everything was connected to the system.

“What kind of mood is Hendrik in?” Aeve wondered as Cathy returned with a black coffee and radio in hand.

“It’s hard to tell, he has his game-face on for sure. Earlier he was leading a group of ambassadors from the African Union around the lab and he seemed...energetic to say the least.”

Aeve slurped the coffee and took a deep sigh before she mumbled into the radio: “Hendrik? It’s Aeve, we’re over in 7-A and we’re ready to get started when you are, over.”

“At last!” Hendrik’s voice boomed through the radio. “We’ve been all over the place looking for you. I want you up here to explain how the system works since we’ve got the Minister of Agriculture and some people over from the NCU, the SELA and the...” Aeve interrupted him — she refused to enter the limelight for even a second. Tonight she was hardly in the mood to watch another bored, bureaucratic face nod along apathetically to her life’s work.

“Fine,” Hendrik muttered after a tense pause.

Aeve felt little remorse about shutting down the conversation because Hendrik’s political ambitions were threatening her work and his excitement was premature. If a test failed on live TV and a few politicians started denouncing their work then it might seriously risk the next round of funding. For Hendrik to hype this evening into a fever pitch amongst members of the press was foolish and perhaps even dangerous. She decided to meet with Hendrik the week before, in hopes of cancelling the event thereby preserving their research or at least keeping their failures private until the time was right, but Hendrik had simply ignored her request.

Amongst the roar of electronic whistles, which appeared to be coming from every corner of the facility, an orange light swirled across the racks and the fluorescents dimmed. Aeve and Cathy walked towards the nearest exit where the sound was the least offensive whilst a voice rose softly out of the confusion: “Warning: labs three and seven will now commence the procedure. T-minus five minutes.”

They zipped up their plastic raincoats, pulled up their hoods and took a final look at the racks in front of them. Fortunately, the sudden, constant beeping in the lab didn’t last for long and was quickly swept up by the distant thud of rain outside. 

“5...4...” Aeve turned to Cathy, smiled, and they fist bumped. “3..” Before them the racks descended as the grass was gently placed into the earth. “2...1...standby,” the voice called out. Sheets of water filled every gap in the surrounding air as the outer skeleton of the lab was stripped off like a crustacean abandoning its shell. Tiny, whirring gears could be heard from the lights that were splitting apart and being packed neatly aside, a set of wheels extended from beneath the walls and began to move them all away.

The barren humidity returned and a patchwork of stars covered by intermittent clouds replaced the ceiling; Aeve and Cathy were teleported to an alien world where together, swaying gently in between sporadic gasps of wind, crystals of charcoal now dotted the landscape. With all this excitement Cathy appeared to be grinning so intensely that it looked as if she might inflict serious, long lasting damage to her cheekbones.

“You know what it reminds me of?” Aeve raised her voice over the movements of the lab’s skeleton which was slowly packing itself up into a fine sheet and could be heard rolling itself towards the main lab. “When I was in high school we played these real time strategy games where you could build factories, or you could harvest fields of wheat and barley with a single gesture. Click, and boom! A thousand soldiers, a dozen tanks, or a fleet of starship destroyers were then yours to command.”

“I know what you mean!” Cathy laughed. “Growing up I spent every waking moment playing Command and Conquer.”

They spun around towards the centre of the compound where giant oblong bubbles of plastic clasped the earth, each illuminated by its own strange colour. Fluorescent orange and blue, electric sparks of red, green and white, the main lab was a gleaming, bubbling heart of bright neon shadows enclosed by hundreds of miles of suffocating gloom. Today it felt like home.

“You know that I backpacked around Berlin last year, right?” Cathy began. “Well in Kreuzberg there were these graffiti artists who were climbing on the sides of buildings. They were painting murals that were five or maybe even six stories tall — and so now looking at this, I think it sort of looks like we just tagged the desert.”

*No kidding*, Aeve thought, looking on the field as if it had been spray-painted by an anti-horticultural thug. “We’re planting seventeen of these tonight,” she whispered under her breath in disbelief.

“Yeah, so this is some kind of world record, I guess,” Cathy acknowledged “It’s the largest display of Saharan graffiti ever.”

“Saharan Graffiti is my favourite Aerosmith album by the way,” Aeve smirked and poked Cathy with her elbow, nodding in the direction of a similar contraption about half a kilometre to the east which was in the process of revealing another synthetic field. Cheers and applause erupted from the radio, which cut off the brief moment of silence, however Aeve was fixed to the spot; she couldn’t head back to the lab and celebrate with Cathy and the rest of the team.

This was the visible stage of the project, the freeze frame that would show up on the news and the bit that would be linked to, favourited and retweeted by millions of people around the world. This would be the moment that everyone would point to because building something tangible was easier to remember, Aeve thought. The tricky part though is maintaining what you’ve built; the real difficulty lies in keeping up the momentum to finish the job, rather than backing out at the first sign of an easy win. Aeve knew that all the gruelling, thankless work that no-one would care about lay ahead of her — but that’s what science ultimately is, she believed, underneath all the clichés and the soundbites. Science wasn’t the eureka moment in the bathtub, it was the fifty years of unrecorded tedium and monotony that led up to the breakthrough.

Aeve was perfectly aware that her work had just begun, but for now; sleep.



## 4 

Aeve was saving the world. At least, that’s the impression she gave her father whenever he flinched at her vocabulary. Words like ‘cyanobacteria’, ‘genetic mutation’ or ‘organelle’ were the H-bombs in Aeve’s weaponised arsenal of conversation killers. Ultimately it was far easier for him to pretend that Aeve’s job was saving the planet than it was to truly understand what that work involved.

“Hi,” Aeve would often begin struggling, flailing, hoping desperately to explain at a party or on a date. What was it precisely that she did for a living? It was difficult, stressful even, to talk with people that weren’t biologists, or with strangers that had never heard of the Sahel, or with angry landlords that couldn’t tell their forbs from their graminoids, or with childhood friends that were incapable of pointing out where the capital of Ethiopia was situated on a map of the world.

“I’m a geneticist, and so, well...” Aeve would trip over her tongue. “I guess I build plants for a living.” Date-guy would always get a minus point if he let this vague, immediate answer fulfil his curiosity. “Most of the time I work at the Millennium Seed Bank at Kew Gardens just around the corner, that’s where I research the genetic structures of the million or so plants that they archive and with whatever data is available I try to solve some really interesting problems. Mostly these are agricultural or environmental issues and lately I’ve been working with an international research team for the first time which, to be honest, is quite scary.”

This was the key moment for date-guy, because it’s here that Aeve would be inextricably propelled by her own excitement; her curiosity would lead her to plants and ecosystems, then off to fossilised vegetation in different parts of the world, or instead she’d move on to foreign habitats and environmental sustainability before finally grappling with the moral arguments challenging her work in genetics.

Aeve would continue: “Have you ever heard of the Sahel by any chance?”

Date guy: “Nope.”

“Okay,” Aeve would begin, her eyes twirling in the dim restaurant lights “the Sahelian Kingdom is a thin stretch of land that criss-crosses Africa, from Mauritania in the west right across Mali, Niger, Chad, Sudan and out towards Eritrea. It spreads across the entire continent and it ends up in the Red Sea, but the important thing to remember is that this strip of land acts as a natural barrier from the jungles in the south of Africa to the deserts in the north. What’s terrifying though is that every country on this imaginary strip is being gobbled up by the approaching Sahara.”

Three date-guys had managed to reach this point in the conversation.

“It’s a process called desertification. Land erosion, poor agriculture and all sorts of other problems have led to environmental devastation on a scale that’s almost unimaginable. But it’s not just a cause for hippies to get angsty about and it’s not just another capital-M ‘Movement’ for them to fly their flags under. It’s a life-and-death situation for the people trying to make a living out there. And so, if they can no longer grow crops or sustain infrastructure like roads, hospitals, schools, you name it, then we’ll watch as millions of people migrate to the south. Then we’ll know it’s over – we’ll have finally ravaged the last bit of wildlife on our planet.”

Two date-guys had recently struck out around this point, one of them glanced around the restaurant unenthusiastically before staring directly at her chest. Neither had any hope to contribute to the discussion, but Aeve was familiar with getting excited about an idea and watching the person before her squirm uncomfortably with boredom. This certainly didn’t stop her from trying, in fact the complete lack of interest was a catalyst for Aeve – she wanted to win them over and teach them at least a little about the fascinating world of genetics.

“The African Union and the UN has finally started to notice just how important this problem is. So after my work is finished here in London, I’ll be joining a team in Mali to research effective ways to stop that process.” Aeve would swirl the wine in her glass, prod the table at certain intermissions and try to draw countries and municipalities in the air to clarify her ideas. Whenever she talked about her job Aeve felt as if she was a broken record, but one that broke on her favourite verse of her favourite song and now it would loop indefinitely forever.

Only one date-guy had exhausted Aeve’s imagination up to this point, donating to her rambling diatribes with questions, jokes and, at all the right moments, giving her serious looks of discomfort. Afterwards they headed to a bar where a crowd of a dozen or so had cloistered themselves around a ping pong table in a cellar, it was here they played a wonderful, eclectic drinking game. PING! Aeve would shout as date-guy drunkenly hit the ping pong ball across the room. It was an evening where complete strangers became friends serendipitously, conversations flowing together like they were all being read off a script. PONG! He’d return in kind as Aeve’s serve hit the net and she’d wash away the embarrassment with another gulp of liquid from a tiny glass.

Date-guy was British, funny and best of all, he had the easiest smile Aeve had ever found. Over the coming months she knew that she wanted to hold onto the sails of his unrelenting, full-bodied laughter, safeguarding each and every moment in a glassy bottle. With her own hands Aeve would build a storehouse to keep these bottles safe, as they’d need to be catalogued by time, place and origin so future archivists could plunder the treasures of his every indistinguishable laugh and his every fleeting smile.

If you happen to find yourself at the bottom of a dark, enclosed stairwell after crossing through a string of corridors which now snake far behind you, and above, in thin, elegant capital letters a sign reads: “THE FUNGARIUM”, then prepare to be greeted inexplicably by a warehouse packed to the rafters with countless boxes, each of them a peculiar shade of fern-green and tagged with a label describing the treasures inside. Lifting them from their resting place you’ll want to shake them like presents but you must, at all costs, avoid such rabid temptations.

This was how Aeve’s introductory tour of the centre of mycology at Kew Gardens began, led by one of her mother’s old friends, Dr. Jane Bower, an elderly, rotund and bespectacled researcher who also happened to be the Principal Mycologist at the Fungarium. Whenever questioned about her unusual work she would smile, remove her glasses and jovially reply (often loudly): “I am merely a humble admirer, a confidant, a familial chum to all fungi, both large and little.” Naturally, she was the perfect tour guide; her eccentric hops from one green package to another would frequently introduce a story or myth which she would then unwrap along with all the innards of the boxes and their contents of dried fungi. And so it was that after passing beneath the fragile, uppercase letters of the sign above the doorway, Aeve recognised an almost child-like energy coursing through her veins, as if she’d been suddenly dropped into Disneyland only to find that above all the pursuits of life there was no greater pleasure than working alongside Goofy and Daffy Duck. Aeve wanted to work, sleep and play amongst these mushrooms.

*“Armillaria solidipes!”* Dr. Bower cried, reading the Latin enchantment aloud whilst, unlocking the box with a swift click, a hairy aroma inexplicably burst into their nostrils. This was a specimen from the Humongous Fungus, she explained, dwarfing the blue whale, related to neither plant nor animal, this mushroom colony had been ranked by the scientific community as the largest organism on Earth. For more than two millennia they had been growing like wildfire across national parks in Oregon, almost invisible from naturalists and biologists alike. They slept for much of the year in the undergrowth deep in the soil until brown caps erupted from their resting grounds later in the spring. 
 
Without these mycological specimens the natural ecosystem could not sustain Aeve’s world of plants, Jane teased, and regardless, the number of individual mushroom species outnumbered plants six-to-one. Therefore much of her work involved naming this growing catalogue of species, in fact it was Dr. Jane Bower who had correctly renamed the *Armillaria solidepes* from the incomprehensible name it had been falsely categorised under so many years before. Throwing aside the tributes she received from this discovery, Jane would often mutter that naming mushrooms was difficult work simply because there were so many mushrooms left to name. “The problem is that there are more specimens of fungi than there are words in the Latin dictionary,” she would often say.

It was here that Aeve would find adoptive parents for her graminoids whilst she worked at the Millennium Seed Bank across the road. One of many secret facilities at Kew Gardens, the Seed Bank had originally been designed as a safe-haven for biologists studying the origins of plant life but later, more than a billion seeds and about ten percent of all species would soon be archived on the premises. During Aeve’s research the Seed Bank slowly became a biological vanguard, fortified against a nuclear holocaust; it was a Fort Knox overflowing with DNA instead of gold.

Examining the genetic structures of every recorded seed on Earth had left Aeve with infrequent moments of spare time, moments in which she would often wonder how her life had become stuffed with so many mushrooms and seeds and underground bunkers. But then there were dreams. In one violent, recurring nightmare Aeve would surface from a crowded strip club where giant, bouncing strings of DNA gyrated hypnotically along the dance poles. A double helix would bend over and Aeve always tucked a hundred dollar bill into its G string before she woke up with a start. Why was she at a grimy strip club though, she wondered. Why would a piece of DNA be wearing see-through underwear, what was it hiding, why was she using dollars instead of pounds and why oh why would these human-sized DNA molecules continue to dance whilst she screamed?

Out of the mumbling confusion, the contents of her dreams would regularly lead Aeve back to the lab at night. However she found it impossible to remain still in front of the microscope or in front of her laptop whilst the rain tumbled along the windows of her office. Partly this was because Aeve had finally begun work on a project that she hoped to whisper into the ears of her friends and colleagues; *Mali, Sahel, a kingdom of graminoids*. Most of all, Aeve desperately wanted to impress Jane, although perhaps it was just another vain attempt to commune with the dead. Through Jane, there was some lasting remnant of her mother, the first black doctor who had fought so viciously to break down the old boys club, only to pioneer Aeve’s inherited field of genetics from the inside out. Perhaps, Aeve wondered, she was simply using Jane as a witness of some kind, a medium through which she could gain access to her mother’s relentless courage.

The lack of rainfall, the terminal state of soil erosion and the scale of the rapidly expanding desert in Mali had been reported in a folder of documents which lay scattered across her desk. Every attempt to solve the problem so far had failed, most of the proposed solutions involved genetically modifying the plant to be physically stronger or to survive under deteriorating and extreme desert conditions. There must be another solution, Aeve thought as she paced the room. Donning a thick coat and gloves, Aeve walked in the Vault, a test lab which the staff had so lovingly renamed. This was the repository of seeds, a warehouse-lab similar to the Fungarium only this extensive room was chilled to a brisk minus twenty below freezing. The seeds were shielded from the outside world in individual containers, plastic and circular with screw-on tops, each containing a single specimen with thousands of copies. 

Looking at row upon row of seeds Aeve couldn’t help but wonder what would happen if you might combine them together. Could you pull a new family of living creatures out of this primordial broth? Could you combine these organisms in a text editor and make their genetic instructions visible on a screen? These were the sorts of questions that haunted her daily schedule. But what would happen if you genetically combined two of the most successful species in the world? What if plants weren’t enough? Aeve remembered the Humongous fungus and recalled how Jane had thrust apart its insides to reveal throbbing white veins. “See, we think of fungi as the mushroom, but that’s just the flower,” she had said. “This network of branching filaments underneath is the real deal, that’s the network that powers the fungi right there. And on top of this network, well...we call it the  *mycelium*, many dead forests lie on the surface – the upper layers only succeed because it’s their ancestors that breathe life into the soil – so the mycelium is the organic material that converts death into life.”

So, Aeve wondered, what would happen if you took the mycelium of a mushroom and bolted it onto a graminoid, like those blades of grass in a field? Perhaps they had been tackling the problem from the wrong end all along, and maybe the plant’s genetics had never been the problem. By giving foundational strength to the soil they could preserve a rich protective layer to sustain life on the surface. Why hadn’t she thought of this before? 

Puffs of breathy smoke floated around the room as she continued to pace up and down the rows. Most of the researchers saw the Vault here as nothing more than an impressive collection of seeds but Aeve knew it to be something much more; she had recently argued it was a repository of billions upon billion of lines of code. They were codes in a language which she could only barely read, but they were codes nonetheless.


## 6.

Smudged together into a vast homogenous blob, their days had passed by without seasonal changes or diverse weather patterns to ease the boredom. Despite the rolling undercurrents of dust that would roll predictably across the surface and rake the earth in a sickly poison, Aeve had never expected that so much hostility could weave itself into everyday moments of life, and consequently just how dull and tedious those dangers could become. All that was left was to count the little scars and scratches that accumulated on her body, as usually the leftover traces from a day spent in the topsoil amongst these odd synthetic plants would contain the following; a powdery soot-like residue will cake your boots, shorts and forehead, a patchwork of bruises will run from your knees to your elbows whilst cuts on the tips of your fingers will sometimes cause them to feel bloated or swollen. Aeve had soon familiarised herself with this work but Cathy would always gather a more savage inventory of wounds. Laying back in the field she watched as a sticky, unpleasant dusk fell over the main lab and groaned whilst she rubbed the sores on her ankles. 

Next to her, Aeve had been preoccupied with yanking both hands around in the dirt  to reveal a peculiar string of biological circuitry. Thread-like, pinky fingers of mycelium stretched out wide to connect one blade of grass to the rest of the network. She decided to take a closer look by withdrawing a scruffy, beaten-up tablet from her backpack with an app she had written solely for this experiment, yet it was bug-ridden to say the least – the screen flickered at random intervals and it wasn’t clear whether the whole thing had silently crashed or not. Given enough time Aeve could eventually parse the statistics from the field test where the researchers patrolled the grief-stricken meadows nearby, but despite all this rich, biological data, over the past fortnight their problems had been driven to the surface so that anyone could bear witness to their failures; the pastures were looking yellow and sickly, even from a distance where bald spots could be seen in the crystal quilt of charcoal all around them.

Disappearing beneath sandy tidal forces, fourteen of the original crops had failed, only three were now holding on desperately for survival and so Aeve felt that her design had been collapsing in between the tips of her fingers; nature still took great joy in finding innovative methods to swallow their efforts whole. But these ecological systems were fantastically complex and complex systems often fail, Aeve chanted. What’s required is more focus and concentration. Devoid of any distractions she could fix this, which is why so much of Cathy’s work had turned into public relations. “If you can micro-manage the bureaucracy and the politicians and the dumb phone calls, I’m sure I’ll be able work out a solution,” Aeve said whilst hiking across the fields earlier that week with Cathy in tow. A torrent of vibrations in Cathy”s pocket would often distract her and Aeve could often hear her outside the lab or in the fields pleading with journalists to hold their embarrassing stories about the latest developments at the lab. Aeve slumped down next to Cathy and followed her gaze over to Mt Hombori which lay far off behind the main lab in the distance, its tower perched on the edge of the plateau like a matchstick. 

Disappointment had set in as Aeve had hoped to find that the beacon would occasionally throw bolts of lightning into the air like in sci-fi movies, but no such luck, it’s commands, like any piece of crucial infrastructure, were always hushed and tranquil. 

Aeve would have to learn the codes, read the skies and connect this tower in the horizon with the fields she had designed, but despite the difficulty of the task, the prospect of failure no longer frightened her. Instead she had begun to obsess over Mali and how it would never look the same. As a biologist she knew that the slightest changes in the environment can have startling consequences on the life forms in the area. “Everything is dependent on certain temperatures, certain landscapes, certain difficulties for life to flourish,” her mother had once said. In fact Aeve no longer dreamt of gyrating strings of DNA, instead she dreamt of sitting at a metal desk in a spotlight being interrogated by her mother: “What effect might this plant have on the long term ecosystem? Where is your research? What right have you to invade this country and tell them to trust you!” Aeve’s mother was much more aggressive in her dreams, as she would prod and poke Aeve’s work from every angle but then she’d ease off suddenly only to remind Aeve to call her father.

Aeve would often watch the sunsets like these and imagine a planet-sized ping pong paddle volleying the sun away, hurtling this giant ball of burning hydrogen in the direction of date-guy’s apartment. She started to message him with 'ping' during these moments at the end of the day, a couple of hours later he’d reply with 'pong' in kind. This interstellar ping pong match became a cute tradition of theirs which consoled them whenever they wanted to stay in touch but didn’t feel like speaking. Receiving one of these short-burst messages was unspeakably intimate; the knowledge that someone on another continent loved her was enough to kindle a smile under any circumstances. Whilst she listened to Hendrik ramble in the canteen or whilst she was outside testing the growth of the fields, she'd let those infrequent messages calm her fragile nerves.

Once her work was finished here, perhaps there'd be couples building their homes on this very plain, she thought. If her research paid off, perhaps Mali would thrive economically again and a new city could be planted amongst these fields. Overlooking the same landscape, these inhabitants would find jungles instead of a rolling, desert tundra and rather than ping pong these lovers would message each other and play games which she couldn't possibly hope to understand. Much like their own messages, these romantic communiqués would, in their own time, become active beacons of love in their own right. Aeve liked to believe that she was building a place where these games would be invented, a place where they might spread and where others might design their own secret letters and valentine ciphers, bits of information which only a single organism in the entire universe might decode. Insignificant messages that were part of a private language in which two lonely people tried their best to pull a thousand miles of dust and empty space an inch closer together.

At any time Aeve could scroll through pictures of him in Laos or Frankfurt or Chicago. She caught messages on other networks—in-between conversations of mutual friends—where they had caught up over breakfast or over drinks. During these moments she'd get an insatiable urge to keep moving whether that was jogging, biking, weight-lifting, whatever physical activity which would best help her counter her urge to communicate with him. Aeve loathed this basic, high school emotional dependency and she often felt like their relationship was a flimsy house of cards that they’d decided to build on a sand dune.

Although, he hadn't replied to her messages for a couple of days and now she was beginning to worry. Their cute, short-lived tradition had reframed the unfamiliar galaxy of stars and planets above, his messages had jumbled them all up. They made a cosmos of uninhabitable wasteland seem almost comical, as if she could roll the pregnant stars above into a ball of dough which might be kept safe in her pocket or which she might lose behind her bedside cabinet. Yet the longer he didn’t reply the larger, the more isolated that space felt. Aeve watched the planets wheel out of control through the extended, transparent wall of the main lab and for a short, panicked moment she saw it; Aeve watched the Red shift spinning everything away. She saw the empty space between things and the darkness of intergalactic space grow mean and wicked. The desert was merely a shadow of the heavens above and once in a while the ocean fields of charcoal would solemnly wave her goodbye.

Maybe Cathy is the one that starts to challenge Aeve – to get her to admit that maybe this isn’t a great idea – that’s its changing Mali forever.

It was precisely what she needed because waiting for the Ping pong beacon to return its signal was sickly, heartbreaking, incurable.

“Mali is never going to look the same again. What happens to the wildlife here? How will the changes that we’ve made effect their diet and their habitat?”

[Aeve is reluctant to admit that she cares less about the people and more about winning the Nobel Peace Prize]

“This was the best idea available.”

“No, this was the only idea.”

A scene about the FESTIVAL AU DESERT

***-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Aeve asks Cathy: “So. Where was it?”

“Huh? Where was what?”

“Google, Apple or Facebook? Who did you turn down to come work all the way out here?”

Cathy later found that this was the First Question in these poorly paid academic circles. 

“Oh, for me it was Google. I toured their offices to see what it might feel like to work at their London HQ. They wanted to ship me in to kickstart a small research team to help flesh out Maps. The offices were absurd though; the whole place looked like it was a haunted house with a sort of nautical theme going on. The doors all looked like submarine hatches, there were giant lights hanging from the ceiling with ropes tying them all together and hardly anyone seemed to be, ya know, working.” Although, they must work particularly hard, Cathy mentioned – the salary she had been offered was laughably absurd. It was more than five times what she had been earning in her freelance work the year before. 

“Ya know, I looked around the place and tried to picture myself there in five years time. I tried to find myself in the eyes of all those white, hoody wearing, sarcastic twenty year old dudes that stalked the halls and, well, I couldn’t do it.”

Sam bailed from Foursquare in New York. After completing his computer science degree in Brazil he emigrated to the states before finding work at an agency called ‘#coolwork’. Hendrik had worked on a secret renewable energy service with a company in Mountain View, but Aeve could never figure out much more than that. Hendrik always described his work like he was reading the blurb of a clandestine document that went *way* above Aeve’s security clearance.

This introduction to the team is what made these people a team. In one way or another they had shunned Silicon Valley and Wall Street of all its wealth and opulence, they had abandoned the glory of hackathons, the four day work weeks and the fridges full of beer. They had thrown their six figure pay checks and five star vacations out the window and bid adieu to free gyms, free meals, free parking, free WiFi, free access to the smartest people in the startup world. They were left with something so much more profound, something that they all shared between one another. 

Each of them was standing on a financial and emotional iceberg together, each of them dependent on the others to survive.

GLITTER! Glitter in her hair. Glitter in her drawers. Glitter under her bed. Glitter in the shower. Glitter in her bag.

Friend puts glitter pretty much everywhere.

Friends don’t let friends go without glitter.

They had given the crops different names (from where though?) Greek mythology? Norse sea tales? What about names from the Icelandic sagas?

She wanted to wake up in between a florist and a bakery.


“Hey, dummy! You ok?” Aeve walked across the field and slumped down beside Cathy who had tripped in the .

Cathy groaned again, sitting upright in the field. “Yeah, I’m fine. I just tripped – it looks like the soil is falling to bits over here.”

“Well...it doesn’t look that bad. Does it?” Aeve said, poking her in the knee and accepting Cathy’s succession of fierce scowls as contrition for all the little pranks that she had played on Aeve over the past six months.
