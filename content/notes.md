Maybe Cathy is the one that starts to challenge Aeve – to get her to admit that maybe this isn’t a great idea – that’s its changing Mali forever.

It was precisely what she needed because waiting for the Ping pong beacon to return its signal was sickly, heartbreaking, incurable.

“Mali is never going to look the same again. What happens to the wildlife here? How will the changes that we’ve made effect their diet and their habitat?”

[Aeve is reluctant to admit that she cares less about the people and more about winning the Nobel Peace Prize]

“This was the best idea available.”

“No, this was the only idea.”

> Man burns a field, believing that if nature intended for the valley to swept of life, then so be it – maybe that is Fate.
> Aeve confronts the native man about the attack once he is captured.
> This scene is about confronting Aeve’s belief that if science can save a biological structure then will change it.
> What if science can save life, and that life changes, is it still worth fighting for?

A scene about the FESTIVAL AU DESERT

***-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Aeve asks Cathy: “So. Where was it?”

“Huh? Where was what?”

“Google, Apple or Facebook? Who did you turn down to come work all the way out here?”

Cathy later found that this was the First Question in these poorly paid academic circles. 

“Oh, for me it was Google. I toured their offices to see what it might feel like to work at their London HQ. They wanted to ship me in to kickstart a small research team to help flesh out Maps. The offices were absurd though; the whole place looked like it was a haunted house with a sort of nautical theme going on. The doors all looked like submarine hatches, there were giant lights hanging from the ceiling with ropes tying them all together and hardly anyone seemed to be, ya know, working.” Although, they must work particularly hard, Cathy mentioned – the salary she had been offered was laughably absurd. It was more than five times what she had been earning in her freelance work the year before. 

“Ya know, I looked around the place and tried to picture myself there in five years time. I tried to find myself in the eyes of all those white, hoody wearing, sarcastic twenty year old dudes that stalked the halls and, well, I couldn’t do it.”

Sam bailed from Foursquare in New York. After completing his computer science degree in Brazil he emigrated to the states before finding work at an agency called ‘#coolwork’. Hendrik had worked on a secret renewable energy service with a company in Mountain View, but Aeve could never figure out much more than that. Hendrik always described his work like he was reading the blurb of a clandestine document that went *way* above Aeve’s security clearance.

This introduction to the team is what made these people a team. In one way or another they had shunned Silicon Valley and Wall Street of all its wealth and opulence, they had abandoned the glory of hackathons, the four day work weeks and the fridges full of beer. They had thrown their six figure pay checks and five star vacations out the window and bid adieu to free gyms, free meals, free parking, free WiFi, free access to the smartest people in the startup world. They were left with something so much more profound, something that they all shared between one another. 

Each of them was standing on a financial and emotional iceberg together, each of them dependent on the others to survive.

GLITTER! Glitter in her hair. Glitter in her drawers. Glitter under her bed. Glitter in the shower. Glitter in her bag.

Friend puts glitter pretty much everywhere.

Friends don’t let friends go without glitter.

They had given the crops different names (from where though?) Greek mythology? Norse sea tales? What about names from the Icelandic sagas?

She wanted to wake up in between a florist and a bakery.


“Hey, dummy! You ok?” Aeve walked across the field and slumped down beside Cathy who had tripped in the .

Cathy groaned again, sitting upright in the field. “Yeah, I’m fine. I just tripped – it looks like the soil is falling to bits over here.”

“Well...it doesn’t look that bad. Does it?” Aeve said, poking her in the knee and accepting Cathy’s succession of fierce scowls as contrition for all the little pranks that she had played on Aeve over the past six months.
