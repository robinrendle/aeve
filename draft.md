How long had she been swearing at the clouds? 

Barreling down the mountain path, and keeping one eye on the sky above whilst she drove, Aeve realised that she couldn’t see the stars. And in Kenya you could *always* see them, they were unavoidable features of the landscape at night. Stars materialised like an alien city hovering above the desert sky, a fractured, luminescent metropolis made up of billions of little bulbs, fractals just lying there ready for someone to trace lines between them all.

“Come on, you useless bastards!” she screamed, her voice carrying far out into the darkness. Yet if there were any clouds above they were certainly unmoved by her florid taunts; the insults quickly escalated into a stream of accusations—she blamed the clouds for everything. Her voice became clear even over the truck’s engine and the tired, rusty *clunk* of gears inside. Her screams broke into whispers, the threats tailed off into hopeful prayers.

Were the stars out tonight or was she simply exhausted? Turning around in every direction, her pickup responded by swinging dangerously from one side of the dirt road to the other. *Concentrate, you idiot*. In her debilitating exhaustion Aeve had forgotten that the surrounding darkness was stacked with danger; she knew the stories well.

Bandits roamed these valleys waiting to pick up on the trickle of researchers that moved back and forth between villages. There were gangs of ex-soldiers, deserted militia and paramilitary units alongside a company of rebel groups which had been said to camp out in the surrounding desert, waiting. They patrolled the landscape for movement of any kind, in search of an easy late-night meal. So setting aside the darkness, the thin dirt track she had been rocketing down at 70mph, and the fact that she only had about two hours of sleep, it was still far too dangerous for Aeve to be driving so recklessly.

Squinting into the blur ahead, a liquid shadow of foreground and background waved in the near distance. She tried to spot the faces of these soldiers, imagining an invisible army of nightmares hidden in amongst the bracken. All she could see was the tiny strip of road through a half-cone of light ahead since she had forgotten to fix a broken headlight the day before–*fuck it!* she thought, *there isn’t a single broken headlight or monster out there that’s mad enough to screw with me tonight.”*

Because tonight was special.

A call had woken her, buzzed her out of bed. An unpredictable rainstorm was inbound, clouds in the horizon building, humidity in the air fluctuating with every breath. She could feel it in her bones, like the way it’s said of experienced pilots that learn to feel the wings of the plane like extensions of their own body. 

Tonight she felt the drop in air pressure. Tonight she could somehow feel the palpitating, beautiful puffy little rain clouds that sat on the horizon. Of course, she had dreamt and planned for this moment a million times before but tonight something was different, this was what she had been waiting for.

“Aeve! Aeve, are you there? Where the hell are you – for fuck’s sake – we need you tonight.” 

“Hang on, what’s wrong?” she gasped sleepily into the phone, trying to hide her excitement as much as possible and pretending not to really know what was going on.

“We. Need. You. Right now! I have no idea where Felix is and we have this storm rolling in. Don’t mess ab—“

She hung up. Holding the phone tightly in her hands, she thought *this was it*. All those years of traveling and waiting, all those delicate years of painstaking field research, had it all been leading up to this evening? Her room seemed to stretch and expand under her feet yet the adrenalin couldn’t quite stop the flow of exhaustion that was currently seeping into her bones.

Before she knew it she was half asleep at the wheel, and fully cloaked by a heavy, formidable darkness. Great spirits of dirt trailed after her jeep in the night.

***

Even in the middle of the night the heat was extraordinary. Aeve fumbled through the passenger seat and salvaged a red dust coated flask; cracking the lid off with a single hand, she gulped as much as possible whilst keeping her eyes on the dirt track.

She momentarily had a powerful urge to check her phone for messages but let it pass. The feeling backed off but now her thoughts were jumping all over *that* and she didn’t want to focus on anything that wasn’t mission critical.

*Wait, was that--rain?* Unable to process anything, she touched her cheek and looked back up at the clouds above. She decided to hit the brakes – the truck lurched forward and the engine dimmed to a mere rumble. Screeching crickets materialised around her, they appeared to be attracted to the car itself. 

Aeve climbed up onto the seats, balancing her weight across the head rests, and held out her arms wide across the roofless jeep. 

the flood was muscling in on the familiar clouds of dirt and now this band of red smoke which clung to everything was in full retreat. Sadly the heat of the evening hadn’t fled in unison, in fact, it seemed to bond with the rain much like how milk bonds with hot chocolate in a saucepan. In her drowsy state she briefly wondered when was the last  time she had watched chocolate melt in her kitchen

as Aeve wound through the track as best she could. The darkness swamped her surroundings to such a degree she beleived she was driving through a black hole at top speed; the flora and fauna whizzed passed at such speed that they were breaking down into pixels and as she hit sixth gear they broke down further into streams of blurry, fuzzy stars. Her broken headlights she tried not to notice how all this natural stuff was being broken down and gobbled up by the surrounding dark. 

Years of work and research had been leading up to a single flash flood; if her team could catch this storm at just the right moment then their work might be propelled forwards by a year, five years, a decade!

She knew right she was driving through the crest of two sweeping mountains and they would magnify the effects of the raincloud tenfold as the rivulets would flow straight towards them. 



Aeve missed the clutch and the whole truck made a terrible ca-thunk as it joltered across the gears — she recognised something! A white tree on the left side of the path had been split right down the middle during a thunderstorm last year; the lab was just ahead.

She came across a clearing where the facility could be seen just below; tents with orange lights gleaming from inside and little colorful dots moving around inside. After dark the facility was breathtaking: a gleaming, bubbling cloud of lights surrounded by hundreds of miles of complete darkness. A small grey outline could be seen with multiple rectangles of metal; this was by far the most impressive biological facility she had ever visited. Grabbing the radio on her waist she called ahead and frantically checked in with her eight digit ID before she threw it into the passenger seat and raced down the hill towards the lab. 

Out there, somewhere in the dark, she knew there were military personnel hidden all along the path towards the base; bored men with eyes wide open, flak jackets equipped with magazines and stun grenades and loaded jeeps with mounted guns and sniper rifles. If she continued to race down the hill like she was without calling up ahead they wouldn’t have flinched to light the entire road with explosive rounds. For a second she flinched, as she thought about how she once decided to walk to the lab one early morning instead – a squadron of these men appeared behind trees silently like clowns creeping out of a tiny car. She knew they were by all accounts these men were 'allies' and not the monsters she had heard so many tales about – but in this peace-keeping operation she’d learnt never to trust anyone. Everyone was suspect, everyone was a thief.

The gate had already been opened in anticipation of her arrival and more military personnel were on patrol near the entrance, these ones with green and red uniforms (these officers, unlike the others, were made to be seen). The scary military police arent this kind, she thought, it’s the kind that hide in the long grass, the soldiers that are trained to appear out of thin air and, without any questions, fire on command.

She held out the keycard pass to the giant of a man at the gate. “They’re looking for you, Miss” he said without looking at the card.



Her mornings and evenings were now smudged into a single homogenous blob without seasons, or time zones, or diverse weather patterns to ease the boredom. Rarely, but then for equally boring months thereafter, an orange undercurrent of dust would predictably roll across the horizon and sweep the environment in a sickly poison. She could never have expected that the most dangerous place on earth, let alone the terrifying, mile-high waves of poisonous orange dust, could begin to grow a little dull.

These rare occurrences aside, the night sky bloomed at night. The dust settled and the stars bloomed.

After college she left to join a terraforming station on Jupiter whilst he decided to stay behind with his sickly father to help him recover. 

The work of her colleagues had turned this once giant-gas planet into a prototype, man-made laboratory. At this stage it was very much like Mars – empty deserts of rock with a useless atmosphere around it.

However the station was now overflowing with holiday cheer — and not just the holidays she was familiar with but a torrent of festivities from Moscow, Beijing, Bombay. 

Regardless of the drinking and games going on in all the labs and dorms of the station, the orangey hint of the biosphere outside looked the same today as it did six months ago.

During a particularly festive winter she would watch the sunsets and imagine a planet-sized ping pong paddle volleying the sun away, hurtling this giant ball of gas back in the direction of his apartment. She started to message him with 'ping' during these cloudy moments at the end of the day. Usually she'd attach an image of some sort; a picture of a videogame she was playing, the paper she was reading for work, or a half glass of wine (which was extremely rare as Saturn was infamously known as the worst producer of wine in the entire solar system). A couple of hours later he’d reply with 'pong' in kind. This interstellar ping pong match became a cute tradition of theirs which consoled them whenever they wanted to stay in touch but didn’t feel like speaking.

Receiving one of these short burst messages was unspeakably intimate; the knowledge that someone on another planet loved her was enough to kindle a smile under any circumstances. During a meeting in which boring, grey men in their lackluster unitards detailed how Jupiter's atmosphere was completely unstable or whilst she was on the distant end of a volcano, blasting wave after wave of radiation and miasma grenades into its core, she'd let those infrequent messages calm her fragile nerves. 

Perhaps once her work was finished here there'd be a couple that would build their home on this very crater, she thought. Perhaps, overlooking the same landscape, they'd find jungles instead and rather than ping pong these lovers would play a mad sport which she couldn't possibly hope to pronounce. Much like their own silly game, these alien forms of communication would, in their own time, become active beacons of love. She was building a place where these games would be invented, a place where they might spread and where others might design their own secret messages requiring ciphers with valentine, digital keys. Bits of information which only a single organism in the entire universe might decode. Insignificant messages that were part of a secret language in which two lonely people tried their best to pull a million miles of dust and empty space an inch closer together.

At any time she could scroll through pictures of him in Laos, in Amsterdam or Shanghai. She caught messages on other networks—conversations between mutual friends—where they had caught up over curry or sushi. During these moments she'd get an insatiable urge to move. Jogging, biking, weight-lifting, whatever physical activity which would help her resist trying to communicate with him. She loathed these feelings of loneliness mixed with her emotional dependency on him.

He hadn't replied to her messages for a couple of days and now she was beginning to worry. Their cute, shortlived tradition had reframed the unfamiliar galaxy of stars and planets around her; his messages jumbled them all up. They made a cosmos of uninhabitable wasteland seem almost comical, as if she could roll the stars into a ball of dough which might be kept safe in her pocket or which she might lose behind her bedside cabinet. But the longer he didn’t reply the larger, the more isolated that space felt. She watched the planets wheel out of control through the glass wall of her office and for a short, paniked moment she saw that nauseous movement of distant objects, the Red shift was spinning everything him away from her. She saw the empty space between things and the darkness of intergalactic space grow mean and wicked.

If you looked close enough you might notice that, throughout this starry sea, a current could be found rolling throughout the cosmos. Sometimes the gaseous swirl looked wondrous but now it was a menacing force swarming all around her. The billions of stars pushed and pulled, sparks of friction buzzing in between them.

The lights in her office momentarily flickered. Power surge? Circuit failure? She’d need to investigate, which meant hours of diligent engineering work looking for crossed fibres in endless racks of electronic circuits. It was precisely what she needed because waiting for the Ping pong beacon to return its signal was sickly, heartbreaking, incurable.

She regulated her breathing, willing the storm outside to clear, and returned to her work.

{SOUND OF MESSAGE} -> What would that sound like 60years from today?
