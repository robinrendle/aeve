How long had she been swearing at the clouds? 

Barreling down the mountain path and keeping one eye on the sky above whilst she drove, Aeve realised that she couldn’t see the stars — but in Kenya you could *always* see them, they were unavoidable features of the landscape at night. Stars materialised, hovering above the desert as a fractured, luminescent metropolis made up of billions of little bulbs and microscopic fractals which lay in wait, ready for someone to trace lines between them all.

However, if the clouds were listening then they were certainly unmoved by her florid taunts; the insults quickly escalated into a stream of accusations as she started to blame the clouds for everything. Her voice became clear even over the truck’s engine and the tired, rusty *clunk* of gears twirling inside. Aeve’s screams soon broke into whispers and after a short while her threats trailed off into hopeful prayers.

Were the stars out tonight or was she simply exhausted? Turning in every direction, her truck responded by swinging dangerously from one side of the track to the other. *Concentrate, you idiot*. In her debilitating exhaustion Aeve had forgotten that the surrounding darkness was stacked with danger, as she knew the stories well enough.

Bandits roamed these desert valleys waiting to pounce on the researchers that moved back and forth between villages. There were gangs of ex-soldiers, deserted militia and paramilitary units alongside a company of rebel groups which had been said to camp out in the surrounding desert. They patrolled the landscape for movement of any kind in search of an easy late-night meal. So setting aside the dirt track she had been speeding through in the darkness, and the fact that she only had about two hours of sleep, it was still far too dangerous for Aeve to be driving so recklessly.

A few moments later she found the foreground and the background began to wave asynchronously into a mushy silhouette. Aeve searched this liquid shadow for the faces of monsters, and she could begin to imagine an invisible army of nightmares hidden in amongst the bracken. But now all she could find was the tiny strip of road, lit by a half-cone of light – she had forgotten to fix a broken headlight the day before. *Fuck it!* she thought, *there isn’t a single broken headlight or monster out there that’s mad enough to screw with me tonight.”*

Because tonight was special; a call had woken her, buzzed her out of bed. An unpredictable rainstorm was inbound, clouds in the horizon building, humidity in the air fluctuating with every breath. She could feel it in her bones like the way it’s said of experienced pilots and their planes, how the fuselage, propellors and the tips of wings become extensions of their own body.

Tonight she felt the drop in air pressure. Tonight she could somehow feel the palpitating, beautiful puffy little rain clouds that sat on the horizon. Of course, she had dreamt and planned for this moment a million times before but tonight something was different. This is was what she had been waiting for.

“Aeve! Aeve, are you there? Where the hell are you – for fuck’s sake – we need you tonight.” 

“Hang on, what’s wrong?” she gasped sleepily into the phone, trying to hide her excitement as much as possible and pretending not to really know what was going on.

“We need you. Right now! I have no idea where Felix is and we have this storm rolling in. Don’t mess ab—“

She hung up. Holding the phone tightly in her hands, she thought *this was it*. All those years of traveling and waiting, all those delicate years of painstaking field research, had it all been leading up to this evening? Her room seemed to stretch and expand under her feet yet the adrenalin couldn’t quite stop the flow of exhaustion that was currently seeping into her bones.

Before she knew it she was half asleep at the wheel, and fully cloaked by a heavy, formidable darkness as great spirits of dirt trailed after her jeep in the night.

Even in the middle of winter the heat was extraordinary. Aeve fumbled through the passenger seat and salvaged a flask coated in sand and dust; cracking the lid off with a single hand, she gulped down as much as possible whilst keeping her focus on the track ahead. Her cellphone fell out of a jacket pocket and skirted the rim of the jeep – she suddenly had a powerful, almost violent urge to check it for new messages, but let the feeling pass.

*Wait, was that?* Unable to process anything, Aeve touched her cheek and looked back up at the clouds above. She hit the brakes and the truck lurched forward, the engine dimmed to a quiet rumble. She jumped up onto the seats, balancing her weight across the head rests, and held out her arms wide across the roofless jeep.

No rain. There were plenty of screeching crickets, which seemed to flock to her as if she was a prophet, but there was no sign of rain.

Aeve breathed in deeply and felt a speck of water on her naked wrist, then her shoulder, and then it ran through her hair. These molecular specks gathered their strength and called for backup, in less than a minute the random drips had formed a torrential downpour. Water darting around freckles and bouncing over her nose, it passed over her light brown complexion and swooped over every inch of Aeve’s skin. She had the oddest sensation that the rain had binding itself to the red dust and sand in the air, as milk blends with hot chocolate in a saucepan.

Giggling like a child, she collapsed into the jeep and accelerated into the night again but now the darkness was pleasant. Rather than stuck in the middle of nowhere she was piloting her jeep through a black hole; the flora and fauna whizzed passed at such speed that they were breaking down into pixels and as she hit sixth gear they broke down further into streams of blurry, fuzzy stars.

Aeve came across a clearing where the facility drew in close beneath her. Tents were illuminated in strange colors; orange and blue, red and green beacons shone from inside. The complex was a gleaming, bubbling cloud of lights surrounded by hundreds of miles of complete darkness. Grabbing the radio on her waist she called ahead and frantically checked in with her eight digit ID before she threw it into the passenger seat and raced down the hill. 

Out there, somewhere in the dark, she knew there were military personnel hidden all along the path towards the base; bored men with eyes wide open, flak jackets equipped with magazines and stun grenades, loaded jeeps with mounted guns and sniper rifles. If she continued to race down the hill without logging in via radio, they wouldn’t have flinched to light the entire road with explosive rounds. For a second she flinched, as she thought about how she once decided to walk to the lab one early morning instead – a squadron of these men appeared behind trees silently like clowns creeping out of a tiny car. She knew these men weren’t the monsters she had heard so many tales about – but in this peace-keeping operation she’d learnt never to trust anyone.

**I think I can skip to inside the facility with her meeting Felix and the rest of the team**

> Some kind of argument about what to do next ensues.
> She falls asleep in the facility
> Wakes up and gets to work planting seeds and testing the soil all along the line.



Her mornings and evenings were now smudged into a single homogenous blob without seasons, or time zones, or diverse weather patterns to ease the boredom. Rarely, but then for equally boring months thereafter, an orange undercurrent of dust would predictably roll across the horizon and sweep the environment in a sickly poison. She could never have expected that the most dangerous place on earth, let alone the terrifying, mile-high waves of poisonous orange dust, could begin to grow a little dull.

These rare occurrences aside, the night sky bloomed at night. The dust settled and the stars bloomed.

After college she left to join a terraforming station on Jupiter whilst he decided to stay behind with his sickly father to help him recover. 

The work of her colleagues had turned this once giant-gas planet into a prototype, man-made laboratory. At this stage it was very much like Mars – empty deserts of rock with a useless atmosphere around it.

However the station was now overflowing with holiday cheer — and not just the holidays she was familiar with but a torrent of festivities from Moscow, Beijing, Bombay. 

Regardless of the drinking and games going on in all the labs and dorms of the station, the orangey hint of the biosphere outside looked the same today as it did six months ago.

During a particularly festive winter she would watch the sunsets and imagine a planet-sized ping pong paddle volleying the sun away, hurtling this giant ball of gas back in the direction of his apartment. She started to message him with 'ping' during these cloudy moments at the end of the day. Usually she'd attach an image of some sort; a picture of a videogame she was playing, the paper she was reading for work, or a half glass of wine (which was extremely rare as Saturn was infamously known as the worst producer of wine in the entire solar system). A couple of hours later he’d reply with 'pong' in kind. This interstellar ping pong match became a cute tradition of theirs which consoled them whenever they wanted to stay in touch but didn’t feel like speaking.

Receiving one of these short burst messages was unspeakably intimate; the knowledge that someone on another planet loved her was enough to kindle a smile under any circumstances. During a meeting in which boring, grey men in their lackluster unitards detailed how Jupiter's atmosphere was completely unstable or whilst she was on the distant end of a volcano, blasting wave after wave of radiation and miasma grenades into its core, she'd let those infrequent messages calm her fragile nerves. 

Perhaps once her work was finished here there'd be a couple that would build their home on this very crater, she thought. Perhaps, overlooking the same landscape, they'd find jungles instead and rather than ping pong these lovers would play a mad sport which she couldn't possibly hope to pronounce. Much like their own silly game, these alien forms of communication would, in their own time, become active beacons of love. She was building a place where these games would be invented, a place where they might spread and where others might design their own secret messages requiring ciphers with valentine, digital keys. Bits of information which only a single organism in the entire universe might decode. Insignificant messages that were part of a secret language in which two lonely people tried their best to pull a million miles of dust and empty space an inch closer together.

At any time she could scroll through pictures of him in Laos, in Amsterdam or Shanghai. She caught messages on other networks—conversations between mutual friends—where they had caught up over curry or sushi. During these moments she'd get an insatiable urge to move. Jogging, biking, weight-lifting, whatever physical activity which would help her resist trying to communicate with him. She loathed these feelings of loneliness mixed with her emotional dependency on him.

He hadn't replied to her messages for a couple of days and now she was beginning to worry. Their cute, shortlived tradition had reframed the unfamiliar galaxy of stars and planets around her; his messages jumbled them all up. They made a cosmos of uninhabitable wasteland seem almost comical, as if she could roll the stars into a ball of dough which might be kept safe in her pocket or which she might lose behind her bedside cabinet. But the longer he didn’t reply the larger, the more isolated that space felt. She watched the planets wheel out of control through the glass wall of her office and for a short, paniked moment she saw that nauseous movement of distant objects, the Red shift was spinning everything him away from her. She saw the empty space between things and the darkness of intergalactic space grow mean and wicked.

If you looked close enough you might notice that, throughout this starry sea, a current could be found rolling throughout the cosmos. Sometimes the gaseous swirl looked wondrous but now it was a menacing force swarming all around her. The billions of stars pushed and pulled, sparks of friction buzzing in between them.

The lights in her office momentarily flickered. Power surge? Circuit failure? She’d need to investigate, which meant hours of diligent engineering work looking for crossed fibres in endless racks of electronic circuits. It was precisely what she needed because waiting for the Ping pong beacon to return its signal was sickly, heartbreaking, incurable.

She regulated her breathing, willing the storm outside to clear, and returned to her work.

{SOUND OF MESSAGE} -> What would that sound like 60years from today?
